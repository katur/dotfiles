# macOS Setup

## macOS Installation

- do not import any TimeMachine backup
- do log into iCloud (can do this later from System Preferences)
- do not set up iKeychain (prefer 1Password)
- do encrypt the disk (i.e. FileVault on), and allow password recovery through
  iCloud password (can do this later from System Preferences)


## System Preferences

- Dock: automatically hide / show
- Date & Time > Clock: 24-hour clock, show day, show date

- iCloud: select only iCloud Drive, Photos, and Find My Mac


## Dock

Remove most everything from the Dock.


## Finder

Show hidden files in Finder:
```
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES
```

Need to restart Finder to see this change (hold option while right-clicking
Finder icon in the dock and click Relaunch)


### Finder > Preferences

- Change what shows up in Favorites sidebar to include home directory,
  and change default to home directory
- Show all filename extensions


## High-Level Applications

Download and Install:

- Chrome
  - Make Chrome the default browser (in System Preferences)
  - Log in to Chrome to sync preferences and extensions
  - Right click on uBlock and uSelect (etc) icons to "Hide in Chrome Menu"
  - In Advanced Settings, change download location to Desktop

    message; perhaps not ready for el capitan. So, do
    [direct download](http://lightheadsw.com/caffeine/) instead.
- Adobe Reader

*These apps should start on system login, which can be set at
System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Items


## Terminal Preferences / OS X Command Line Tools

Edit Terminal preferences for black background, 13pt font, rows and
cols to fill screen, no Audible bell, and unqualified Visual bell.

Download and install OS X Command Line Tools (to get here, follow
instructions on prompt that appears during git init attempt)

NOTE: after macOS Sierra upgrade, git was broken. do this to re-install macOS
Command Line Tools:
```
xcode-select --install
```

Download a vim-powerline-patched (-glyphed) font, and install it by copying
it into Font Book app. Once installed, change Terminal preferences
to use the font. I got: Droid Sans Mono for Powerline Regular.


## SSH

Create SSH keys (no passphrase for now; to add later,
[see this](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-ssh-changing-passphrase/)):
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "my_email@lemonparty.org"
```


## Homebrew

Install Homebrew for OS X package management:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```


## Git

```
brew install git
```

Set bare bones global git configuration:
```
git config --global user.name "My Name"
git config --global user.email "my_email@lemonparty.org"
git config --global push.default simple
```

Add SSH public key to SSH Keys in my GitHub personal settings.


## Dot Files

```
sudo gem install homesick
```

### *If setting up homesick for the first time*

Create repo in GitHub called `dotfiles`.

Clone the repo:
```
homesick clone katur/dotfiles
```

Edit `~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/.git/config` to use the SSH URL instead of
the HTTP URL for connecting (can find this URL in the repo on GitHub).

Create directory to hold the files that will be symlinked into `~`:
```
mkdir ~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/home
```

Add/move `.bash_profile` and `.bashrc` files (or whatever shell configuration
files you want) to `~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/home`. Commit and push
changes. Then, to create the symlinks into `~`:
```
homesick symlink dotfiles
```

The bash settings should now work properly (if not, try restarting Terminal).

Move the global git config file to the repo, too:
```
mv ~/.gitconfig ~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/home/
homesick symlink dotfiles
```

### *If already have a homesick repo*

Follow same steps to clone the repo and to use SSH instead of HTTP.

Before creating symlinks, might have to remove certain dotfiles that
might already exist (e.g. ~/.gitconfig, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bashrc, etc)

Now create the symlinks:
```
homesick symlink dotfiles
```


## Vim

### *If setting up homesick for the first time*
To prevent committing temporary vim files and logs, make sure these
are present in `~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/.gitignore`:
```
*.netrwhist
*.swp
```

Add/move `~/.vimrc` file and `~/.vim` directory to
`~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/home`, then create the homesick symlinks
(do this right away, before ~/.vim is regenerated):
```
homesick symlink dotfiles
```


#### Language-specific vim rules

Create ftplugin directory for language-specific vim rules:
```
mkdir ~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/home/.vim/ftplugin
```

Here is an example Python rules, to put in
`~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/home/.vim/ftplugin/python.vim`:
```
setlocal tabstop=4
setlocal softtabstop=4
setlocal shiftwidth=4
```


#### Vim package management with Pathogen

Install pathogen as a git submodule in the dotfiles repo
(see
[this tutorial](http://www.tedreed.info/setup/2012/03/30/pathogen-and-plugins/)
and
[this cheatsheet about git submodules in general](http://blog.jacius.info/git-submodule-cheat-sheet/)):
```
cd ~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles
git submodule add https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen.git home/.vim/bundle/vim-pathogen
```

*NOTE:* if encounter problem with `tags` files changing the pathogen repo,
try the following, per the
[pathogen FAQ](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen/blob/master/README.markdown#faq)
(I did not do this yet, because I think it is not an issue due to using a
git submodule):
```
git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.cvsignore'
echo tags >> ~/.cvsignore
```

To start pathogen, add these to `~/.vimrc`:
```
runtime bundle/vim-pathogen/autoload/pathogen.vim
call pathogen#infect()
```


#### Vim packages

Install packages as git submodules in the dotfiles repo:
```
cd ~/.homesick/repos/dotfiles
git submodule add https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim.git home/.vim/bundle/ctrlp
git submodule add https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic.git home/.vim/bundle/syntastic
git submodule add https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown.git home/.vim/bundle/vim-markdown
git submodule add https://github.com/kchmck/vim-coffee-script.git home/.vim/bundle/vim-coffee-script
git submodule add https://github.com/bling/vim-airline home/.vim/bundle/vim-airline
git submodule add https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree home/.vim/bundle/nerdtree
```

To configure Syntastic, add the
[recommended syntastic settings](https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic#3-recommended-settings)
to .vimrc.


### *If already have a homesick repo

Not much should be needed, but make sure to remove any already-present
`~/.vim` or `~/.vimrc` prior to making the symlinks.


## Python

[Here](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Homebrew-and-Python.md)
is the Homebrew documentation about brewing Python.
```
brew install python
brew install python3
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip3 install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

*NOTE:*
When I originally installed and upgraded python3, I ran into
this issue.

However, the --upgrade command overwrites the default pip and easy_install
such that they use python3 instead of python2, despite the fact that
these files exist in python2 directories.
[This is a known issue.](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/25752)
So, since I do not need Python 3 right now anyway, I uninstalled the brewed
Pythons and packages, and started over, brewing only python2.

*ENDNOTE*


Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper for creating isolated Python
package environments, and flake8 for syntax and style checking (which I
do in vim with Syntastic):
```
pip install virtualenv
pip install virtualenvwrapper
pip install flake8
```

*NOTE:*
I also did these with pip3, though shouldn't have, because in doing so,
the virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper shell scripts (in /usr/local/bin)
were overwritten to be python3, not python2. This might be related to the
previous issue mentioned (or not?).
```
pip3 install virtualenv
pip3 install virtualenvwrapper
pip3 install flake8
```

To fix:
```
pip install --upgrade virtualenv
pip install --upgrade virtualenvwrapper
rm /usr/local/bin/virtualenv-clone
```

*ENDNOTE*


Confirm virtualenvwrapper config is in `~/.bashrc`:
```
export WORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs
source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh
```


## MySQL

```
brew install mysql
```

Have MySQL start on startup:
```
ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mysql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
```

Run this script for setting a root password (and some other setup):
```
mysql_secure_installation
```

Choose these options:

  - Set root password? [Y/n] Y
  - Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] n
  - Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] Y
  - Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] n
  - Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] Y


Log in as root user to create a dev user:
```
mysql -u root -p
mysql> CREATE USER 'dev'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'dev'@'localhost';
```


## Web Dev Stuff (sass, coffee, etc)

```
sudo gem install sass
brew install node
sudo npm install -g coffee-script@1.9.0
sudo npm install -g gulp
```

Note: there is a bug in coffee-script@1.9.1


## LaTeX

Homebrew does not have LaTeX, and suggests using MacTeX.
Download and install the BasicTeX distribution from
[MaxTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex).
This is a ~100MB subset of the ~2GB full distribution, without
the GUIs and some other stuff.

Download and install the latest release of
[TeX Live Utility app](http://amaxwell.github.io/tlutility/),
for package management. Use this to require needed packages (e.g. enumitem).


# GPG
```
brew install gpg
gpg --list-keys
```
This creates dir ~/.gnupg, file ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf, file ~/.gnupg/pubring.gpg,
and file ~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg

TODO: I still need to set up my gpg keys. Research whether this should
relate to ssh keys. Also might want to get the keys off my old laptop,
since I may have registered these in places.


## Miscellaneous command line packages
```
brew install pv
brew install tree
brew install bash-completion
```


## Heroku
Download and install
[Heroku Toolbelt for OS X](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/).


## After El Capitan update

Restore my ownership of /usr/local
```
sudo chown $(whoami):admin /usr/local && sudo chown -R $(whoami):admin /usr/local
```


## Jekyll
```
sudo gem install jekyll
```


## Java

First installed Eclipse for Java:
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/mars/2/eclipse-java-mars-2-macosx-cocoa-x86_64.tar.gz

I also installed the legacy Java 6 runtime, from:
https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1572?locale=en_US

But then I got the error message:
```
Version 1.6.0_65 of the JVM is not suitable for this product.
Version: 1.7 or greater is required
```

And switched to brewing stuff. First I got brew-cask:
```
brew tap caskroom/cask
brew install brew-cask
```

Because this gave the caveat:
```
==> Caveats
You must uninstall this formula. It is no longer needed to stay up to date,
as Homebrew now takes care of that automatically.
```

I did:
```
brew uninstall brew-cask
```

Then the following (which required password to write to
/opt/homebrew-cask/Caskroom):
```
brew cask install java
```

Then I installed jenv:
```
brew install jenv
```

And added the following to .bashrc, to initialize jenv:
```
if which jenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(jenv init -)"; fi
```

Then I added the newly installed java:
```
jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_92.jdk/Contents/Home/
```

- [PSequel](http://www.psequel.com/)

```
brew install postgres
brew services start postgresql
brew services stop postgresql
```


## VirtualBox

Install VirtualBox from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Thought I needed the below to use https://github.com/xdissent/ievms/ (but then
got MD5 issues with it, so abandoned after brewing unar):
```
brew install unar
```

Install IE9 (Win7), IE10 (Win7), IE11 (Win81), and Edge (Win10 Stable) from
https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/

Launch VirtualBox and import each by doing File > Import Appliance, and
selecting the .ovf file. From there, the defaults are fine.
