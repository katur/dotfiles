# dotfiles


My dotfiles, along with some other documentation, for setting up my computer.

Install with [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

Files to be symlinked into ~ (e.g. .bashrc and .vimrc),
are located in [home](/home).

Informal documentation on my steps to set up a new OS X box
(software installations and preference changes in addition to dotfiles)
in [os_setup.md](os_setup.md).
