# dotfiles
My dotfiles, along with some other documentation, for setting up my computer.

Install with [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick).

Files to be symlinked into ~ (e.g. .bashrc and .vimrc), are located in [home](/home).

Find informal documentation on steps I perform to set up a new OS X box (software installations in addition
to dotfiles) in [os_setup.md](os_setup.md).
